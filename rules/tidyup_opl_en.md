# Tidy Up for OPL

* This task focuses on object recognition and grasping through tidying up a room.
* The rules of this competition are a customized version of Tidy Up, one of the competitions of World Robot Challenge in [World Robot Summit 2020](https://worldrobotsummit.org).
* Please read the [WRS2020 rulebook](https://wrs.nedo.go.jp/wrs2020/challenge/download/Rules/DetailedRules_Partner_EN.pdf), and only the differences from the original rules are shown in this document. (The rules in this document take precedence over the original rules.)

#### Settings

##### Environment

- The arena will be the same as in WRS2020, but for some teams, such as online teams, it is acceptable that the arena cannot be reproduced perfectly.

##### Objects

- Known objects: A list of 3 classes (Food items, Kitchen items, Task items), 3 objects per class, 9 objects in total will be released by the steering committee in advance.
- Unknown objects: 1 object for each class, and a total of 3 objects will be set and announced by the OPL committee just before the start of the competition.
- Boss-character: Boss-character is not set in this task.

#### 3.5 Before the Competition

A few days to a few weeks before the competition

- Known objects will be sent to each team by mail from the OPL committee.
  - Known objects may be opened and used for adjustment as soon as they arrive.
  - Unknown objects will be marked on the box and must not be opened (for online teams).

From 30 minutes before the competition

- The committee members will inform the teams of the initial locations of the objects, and the teams must arrange the objects accordingly.
- The organizer will give each team the number of the Unknown objects. Each team must open the box with the number, take out the objects inside, and place them as instructed by the organizer.

#### 3.6 During the Competition

- The task will be performed simultaneously by all participating teams.

### 3.7 Scores

- Bonus Points
  - Boss-character: Boss-character is not set, so there are no bonus points associated with it.
